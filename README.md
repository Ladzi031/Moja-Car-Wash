# A Simple Car-Wash managment application

# some of the tools used
 --> Spring-boot(web, jpa, security)
 --> postgres
 --> Docker
 --> Jwt

# Users
--> Customer (NO login required)
--> Car-Wash-supervisors (manage the day to day activities of a car-wash spot)

# Customer-functions
--> set an appointment.
--> track the progress/state of the Car.

# Car-Wash-supervisor functions
--> manage employees. (add and delete)
--> oversee cars. (check off car for completion, check on car progress/state)

This project is part of an effort of learning spring-boot/java.
i'll will probably move the front-end to Angular.
